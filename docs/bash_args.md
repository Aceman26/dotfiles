If the previous command had two arguments, like this
```  ls a.txt b.txt```
and you wanted the first one, you could type
```  !:1```
giving
```  a.txt```
Or if you wanted both, you could type
```  !:1-2```
giving
```  a.txt b.txt```
You can extend this to any number of arguments, eg:
```  !:10-11```
